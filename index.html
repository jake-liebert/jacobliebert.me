            <div class="about-content">
                <div class="about-text">
                    <p class="about-lead">I learned leadership on a nuclear submarine, earned technical depth through a CS degree, and refined strategic thinking at Duke.</p>
                    <p>I don't just build products—I drive organizational transformation. When I built Walmart's forecasting platform, I didn't just ship software. I changed how Finance and Merchandising collaborate, replaced manual Excel processes with ML-driven planning, and got 6 business units to adopt a shared system. That's change management at $650B scale.</p>
                    <p>I think in systems, not features. When I walked into Walmart's forecasting problem, I didn't see a dashboard gap—I saw Finance and Merchandising operating on different truths. Built a platform that unified them. When ML models shipped with 30% accuracy gains, I didn't celebrate early—I validated coverage expansion before scaling.</p>
                    <p>I operate at the intersection where technical credibility meets executive influence. I've presented quarterly roadmaps to C-suite stakeholders, built consensus across SVP leaders for $100M+ initiatives, and secured multi-year platform investments by translating ML capabilities into P&L impact.</p>
                    <p>I'm most valuable when the problem is ambiguous, the stakes are high, and success requires both building the right team and building the right product.</p>

                <p class="future-lead">I'm most energized by ambiguous 0→1 problems at enterprise scale—where technical credibility, executive influence, and operational discipline converge.</p>
                <p>I'm drawn to roles where AI/ML strategy directly shapes capital allocation, and where building the right team matters as much as building the right product. The best problems are the ones where nobody's sure it can be done, the stakes justify the investment, and success requires both shipping code and shipping organizational change.</p>
                <p>I've built platforms that inform billions in decisions at Walmart. Next, I want to lead product at a company where AI/ML strategy shapes competitive advantage—whether that's as VP/Chief Product Officer driving transformation at scale, or as a founding product leader at a company betting its future on AI.</p>
